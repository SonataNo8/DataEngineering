Q: If you were asked to impute null values in a column of a file that was 365 Gigabytes, what would you do?  What tools would you use?  What tools would you NOT use?
 
fillna() in the pandas library would get the job done. I'm morbidly curious how sed would perform in comparison. I wouldn't use anything else, specifically no kind of editor that would attempt to load the file into memory.
