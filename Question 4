Q: If you were asked to impute null values in a column of a file that was 365 Gigabytes, what
would you do?  What tools would you use?  What tools would you NOT use?
 
A: fillna() in the pandas library would get the job done. I'm morbidly curious how sed would 
perform in comparison. I wouldn't use anything else, specifically no kind of editor that 
would attempt to load the file into memory.
