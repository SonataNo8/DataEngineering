Q4: If you were asked to impute null values in a column of a file that was 365 Gigabytes, what
would you do?  What tools would you use?  What tools would you NOT use?
 
A: fillna() in the pandas library would get the job done. I'm morbidly curious how sed would

anything that would attempt to load the file into memory.
