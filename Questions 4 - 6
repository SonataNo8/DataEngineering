Q4: If you were asked to impute null values in a column of a file that was 365 Gigabytes, what
would you do?  What tools would you use?  What tools would you NOT use?
 
A: fillna() in the pandas library would get the job done. I'm morbidly curious how sed would 
perform in comparison. I wouldn't use anything else, more specifically no kind of editor or 
anything that would attempt to load the file into memory.


Q5: What would you do if you were asked to do the above task every Thursday morning at 2:00am?

A: I'd write a python script to handle the task and use cron to schedule it. e.g.
0 2 * * THU /data/script.py


Q6: Who is your favorite mathematician, statistician or computer scientist and why? 
A: I credit Leonhard Euler for making mathematics interesting enough to pursue
on my own time, though the vast majority of his work is still over my head.
